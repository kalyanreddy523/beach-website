                <p class="card-text text-black">
                    Juhu Beach is located on the shores of the Arabian Sea. It stretches for six kilometres up to Versova.The short, rocky formations make up the Juhu Beach unlike the Marina Beach in Chennai that is primarily sandy. It is a tourist attraction throughout the year and is also a destination for shooting films. The beach generally gets more crowded on weekends and public holidays. The food court at its main entrance is known for its 'Mumbai style' street food, notably bhelpuri, pani puri and sev puri. Horse-pulled carriages used to offer joyrides to tourists for a small fee but have been banned now. Acrobats, dancing monkeys, cricket matches, toy sellers,Youth are playing old games vie for tourist's attention. The beach is among the most popular sites in the city for the annual Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations where thousands of devotees arrive in grand processions, carrying idols of the Lord Ganesh of various sizes, to be immersed in the sea at the beach. Juhu Beach is also a common spot for plane spotting as a portion of it lies underneath the departure path from Runway 27 and occasionally, the arrival path from Runway 09 of Mumbai Airport. There are several small entrances to the beach throughout the stretch, however the main and most used entrance is near Hotel Ramada Plaza By Wyndham Palm Grove. The best time to visit Juhu Beach is from September to May, as during the monsoon period of June to August the tide is mostly high which makes it dangerous to wander around on the beach

                    Kashid is a beach village in Murud taluka on the shores of the Arabian Sea, in the North Konkan region of Maharashtra, India. It is located 15 km from Murud City and 135 km from Mumbai on the Alibag-Murud road. The beach is wedged between two rocky hills in a semi circular arch and is possibly the finest stretch of the sea in North Konkan between Mandwa and Murud-Janjira.Now water sports activities are also available on the beach during peak hours. Hotels and homestays are available all along the State highway which runs close to the beach. However other than one or two of the luxury hotels, the others can be below par especially after the Covid induced lockdown that killed the travel and industry for close to two years . There are some places to visit and in around Kashid like the Phansad Bird sanctuary, the Korlai fort and the Datta Mandir at Revdanda. A Ro-Ro ferry service started about two years ago, allows one to drive down to Kashid on a ship from Ferry Wharf to Mandwa and then by road from there on.However prior reservations are a must especially on week-ends.

                    Akshe Beach is a popular beach and a vacation spot in Aksa village in Malad, Mumbai, India. It is situated close to Marvé Beach.[2][3] It is a popular weekend destination. It is dotted with many private cottages and hotels, some of which are rented out to tourists and visitors.[2] Aksa beach also happens to be one of the cleanest beaches in the city of Mumbai[4]

                <h5 class="card-title text-black text-center">GORAI BEACH</h5>
                <p class="card-text text-black">
                    Gorai ([goɾai]) is a village at Dharavi Bhet, in Mumbai, India. It is located on the North-western part of the island of Salsette. Gorai is accessed more usually by a ferry crossing the Manori Creek and Gorai creek or otherwise by the overland route through Bhayander. Gorai is bordered by the villages of Manori and Uttan, Pali, Chowk, Dongri, Tarodi, Rai, Morva and Murdhe.[1]
                    Until the 1980s, Gorai was known for its clean beaches and palm trees. However, with the increase in pollution around Mumbai, the Arabian Sea is unfit for swimming although Gorai is less polluted than the other beaches in Mumbai. Gorai still enjoys its calm, laid back charm quite in contrast to the fast-paced life of the city just on the other side of the creek. Bullock carts are still in use here and the area suffers from a water shortage but with real-estate developers steadily bulldozing their way into this prized suburban tract, the physical and cultural fabric of the villagers of Gorai is now quite endangered.[2]
                    The Essel World, the first and the biggest amusement park of India, was built in Gorai in 1986. The park has several rides that cater to all age groups, and is known for its colossal infrastructure. The Global Vipassana Pagoda, featuring the tallest pillar-less dome in the world, a place for meditation, is built on 13 acres of land near Gorai. It is similar in shape to the Shwedagon Pagoda in Yangon, Myanmar
